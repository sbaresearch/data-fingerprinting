# [Fingerprinting Relational Data](https://www.google.com/maps/@43.7032839,15.726723,623m/data=!3m1!1e3)
Fingerprinting toolbox is a library that allows embedding and extracting fingerprints into the relational data.

:anchor: **This repository contains the official implementation of NCorr-FP. See: [NCorr-FP README.md](NCorrFP/README.md)**

## Usage
You can use the toolbox by cloning this repository.
```
$ git clone https://github.com/tanjascats/fingerprinting-toolbox.git
```
### Fingerprint embedding (insertion)
For fingerprint insertion, we can define the scheme with the parameter gamma and bit-length of a fingerprint. The number of modified rows in the data will then be approx. #rows/gamma (TIP: use gamma to control the amount of modifications in the data). 

```
scheme = Universal(gamma=2, fingerprint_bit_length=64)
```

After the scheme is initialized, we can embedd the fingerprint using our (owner's) secret key and specifying recipient's ID: 

```
fingerprinted_data = scheme.insertion("my_data.csv", secret_key=4370315727, recipient_id=0)
```

### Fingerprint extraction (detection)
For the fingerprint extraction, we provide the suspicious data and the secret key used for embedding:

```
suspect = scheme.detection("suspicious_data.csv", secret_key=4370315727)
```
