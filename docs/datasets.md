# Datasets

## Phase 1: 
The fingerprinted dataset is available at: [Financial_Records.csv](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sbaresearch/data-fingerprinting/refs/heads/speml/docs/static/Financial_Records.csv)

This dataset represents credit scoring data. It includes both demographic and financial attributes for individuals, along with a binary target variable indicating credit risk. The dataset can be used for a credit scoring model. 

- Demographic attributes: `age`, `sex`, `marital_status`, `job`, `employment_since`, `foreign`
- Financial behavior: `credit_history`, `credit_amount`, `purpose`, `duration`, `installment_rate`, `debtors`, `checking_account`, `savings` 
- Living and credit circumstances: `housing`, `existing_credits`, `liable_people`, `property`, `residence_since`, `monthly_rent_or_mortgage`
- Behavioral signals: `online_banking`, `tel`
- Target: `default` indicates the creditworthiness of the individual (1 = good, 2 = bad)

## Phase 2: 
The dataset will be available on TUWEL starting April 10th. As per details in [Phase 2 description](_phase2.md), the dataset is the same Financial Records dataset, this time containing a different fingerprint.

The exceptions for late submission of Phase 1: The dataset will be available in TUWEL once you submit the Phase 1 report.
